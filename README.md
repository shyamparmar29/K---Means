# K-Means

# K-Means on digits : 
Here we will attempt to use k-means to try to identify similar digits without using the original label information. This might be similar to a first step in extracting meaning from a new dataset about which you don't have any a priori label information.

 # K-Means for color compression :
One interesting application of clustering is in color compression within images. For example, imagine you have an image with millions of colors. In most images, a large number of the colors will be unused, and many of the pixels in the image will have similar or even identical colors. We've used k-means to compress an image using pyhton.
